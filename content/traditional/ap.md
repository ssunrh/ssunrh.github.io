Myth is a tool for humans to explain the world around them. Even now, with such large advances in science and technology, these stories play an important role in culture and arts; tales of tradition that were once passed down generations orally have been immortalized in literature and contemporary media and entertainment. In this investigation, I wanted to explore the sustainability of **folklore and myth** and its influences on modern society through a Chinese perspective. Researching led me to explore the vast variety of geographical landscapes in China, uncovering lcoal folklore and lesser-known deities. In building my portfolio, I also took visual inspiration from different Chinese aesthetics and art forms through the ages.
