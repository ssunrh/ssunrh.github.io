![1]

## hello! my name is sarah,
i'm currently a psychology/cognitive science undergrad based in california. i consider myself a digital illustrator, though i dabble in graphic design and painting sometimes as well!
i specialize in clean lines, bright colors, and strong silhouette and shape language.

when i'm not drawing, you can find me playing video games, cheering my heart out to esports games, reading books/webnovels, or crocheting!
